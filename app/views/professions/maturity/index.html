                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Builds teamwork across the department</h3>
                <p>Communities of practice let people from different teams work together. Normally, you might only work
                    with people in the same team as you.</p>
                <p>In a community of practice, you could work with people across different professions and teams and
                    work together on common problems or objectives.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Improve processes</h3>
                <p>Working together means we can create processes which work for designers across the department.</p>
                <p>With everyone having an opportunity and say on how we do things, cast a second, or third eye over
                    guidance, and agreeing common ways of doing things, we can design and build more consistent service
                    which work better for our users.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Improving skills and knowledge</h3>
                <p>Being part of a community and a profession gives us a chance to learn from each other. This ongoing
                    learning makes us all more skilled and knowledgeable, which in the long run, makes our whole design
                    profession more effective.</p>
                <p>We've recently run workshops and sessions on accessibility. Especially focusing on how we use digital
                    tools such as whiteboarding tools and considering colleagues with access needs.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Better communication</h3>
                <p>The communities also break down the siloes between different teams. By regularly talking with
                    colleagues from other areas, we can understand problems which may be shared or specific to a
                    business area.</p>
                <p>This improves how we communicate as a whole, making it easier to get things done.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-we-measure-maturity">How we measure maturity</h2>
                <p>We carry out an annual design maturity survey across the design professions every September. This
                    helps to identify how any initiatives are working and if there are areas we need to focus on
                    improving.</p>

                <p>We measure our maturity against the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/"
