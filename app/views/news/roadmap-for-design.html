                DesignOps have launched a [roadmap for design](/roadmap) to improve the consistency, accessibility, and effectiveness of digital services across the department.

                This initiative aims to create a more seamless experience for users, ensuring that digital services are well-designed, efficient, and meet the needs of everyone, including those with disabilities.

                The Design Roadmap will provide a structured, strategic approach to:

                * Ensure design consistency by embedding shared principles, patterns, and a unified design system
                * Improve accessibility compliance so that all services meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards
                * Develop design capability and career progression pathways for designers across DfE
                * Enhance user experience research and service mapping to create seamless, user-friendly digital services
                * Introduce shared performance metrics to track design quality and usability across DfE

                ## Building a Stronger Digital Future for Education

                With this roadmap, we are making a commitment to delivering high-quality digital services that are easy to use, accessible to all, and designed with users in mind. 

                The roadmap aligns with key DfE and GOV.UK objectives, ensuring that services are:

                * User-centred – Designed around real needs, based on research and data
                * Efficient and scalable – Reducing duplication and improving cross-service consistency
                * Compliant and inclusive – Meeting legal accessibility requirements and usability standards
                * Innovative and future-proof – Supporting digital transformation across government

                ## What’s Next?

              
                Over the coming months, we will:

                * Expand the DfE Design System, ensuring common components and styles are easily reusable
                * Strengthen accessibility training and support for all digital teams
                * Improve service mapping and user journey mapping
                * Develop objectives and personal development plans for all designers

                ## Get Involved

                If you’re working on digital services within DfE, this roadmap is for you.
