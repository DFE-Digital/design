      Your transactional service cannot be built onto GOV.UK, however, it's important your users start their journey on
      GOV.UK.<br><br>
      You should not include detailed guidance in your service. GOV.UK guidance pages are good for explaining

        the DigiComms team to discuss this further.</a> DigiComms can also support in the development of new guidance
      pages if existing GOV.UK content does not properly support your service.<br><br>
