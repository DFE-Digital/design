   <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--red">Level A</strong>
   <p>Success Criterion 3.2.6 concerns itself with how you present information about getting help from a person like a call centre, or automated contact process like a chatbot.</p>
   <p>This Criterion is helpful to everyone on how to get help, but especially for people who have cognitive or memory problems.</p>
   <p>For example, if you have a phone number or email address in a header or footer of a page, then that needs to be in the same place on every page.</p>
   <p>It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require us to provide help or access to help. The Criterion only requires that when one of the listed forms of help is available across multiple pages that it be in a consistent location.</p>
   <p>This Criterion does not apply where the details of an email address or phone number are on a contact page.</p>

   <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--red">Level A</strong>
   <div class="govuk-inset-text">If you are building services which ask users for the same information multiple times, think about what changes you need to make, to meet this Success Criterion.</div>
   <p>Success Criterion 3.3.7 ensures that users are not asked to enter the same information twice, in the same session.</p>
   <p>This reduces cognitive load on the user but also makes forms and services easier to use for everyone, and removes the frustration of "Why are you asking for this again, I've already entered this information".</p>
   <p>To meet this Criterion, you should:</p>

   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>prepopulate the field with the information previously entered in a previous step</li>
      <li>or allow the user to select the information from a select list or radio list</li>
      <li>or use a checkbox to confirm information is the same as previously entered, such as ticking a box to confirm the school's correspondence address is the same as the school's main address.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>This Criterion does not apply to essential duplication, such as where confirming a password is needed, or where information has been provided in a different format, for example, a document with their name on has been uploaded, you can ask them to type their name out into a field.</p>

   <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--yellow">Level AA</strong>
   <div class="govuk-inset-text">If you are building services which make use of authentication methods, take time to understand if this Success Criterion will impact your service, now.</div>
    <p>Success Criterion 3.3.8 relates to the use of cognitive function (memory) tests to authenticate a user, for example, remembering a password or solving a puzzle such as "What does 1+2 equal" or using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAPTCHA</a> tests which ask you to identify a word or other characters.</p>
    <p>CAPTCHA involving identifying common objects are an exception, for example, "Select all images of chimneys"</p>
    <p>To meet this Criterion all inputs used in authenticating a user should support copy and pasting values so include <code>autocomplete</code> on inputs and allow password managers to store and retrieve passwords and credentials for a service.</p>
    <p>If there is more than one step in the authentication process, such as with multi-factor authentication, all steps should comply with this Success Criterion. There should be a path through authentication that does not rely on cognitive function tests.</p>
    <p>If a code is sent to a user's device and requires them to retype this into a service, then this is a failure of this Criterion.</p>
    <p>Often referred to as "<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/passwordless/authentication-methods/email-magic-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic Links</a>", you could send a link to the user's email address which can sign them in without having to type in a password. This would successfully meet this Criterion.</p>
