        <p class="govuk-body">If you're interested in retraining to become a content designer, here are some steps you
          can take:</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Learn about content design</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Before starting your training, it's important to have a good understanding of what content
          design is and what it entails.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Research online, read books, attend events, and talk to professionals in the profession to
          get an idea of what content design involves.</p>

            London</a> has some great books to read and courses to attend.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Develop relevant skills</h3>

          research, UX/UI design, and project management. Consider taking courses or workshops that can help you develop
          these skills.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Get experience</h2>
