## A


### Agile

Agile is a project management methodology which focuses on delivering value and outcomes to users quicker than traditional [waterfall](#waterfall) approaches.

Instead of delivering everything in one go, features are delivered iterativley by teams working on focused tasks to deliver an outcome.

### Alpha

A phase in the delivery lifecycle which is after [discovery](#discovery) and before [beta](#beta).

In the alpha phase, you're expected to test your riskiest assumptions, build prototypes, try different solutions to solve your problems to meet you user needs.

You may also have a [service assessment](#service-assessment) before the end of your alpha phase.

## B

### Beta

A phase in the delivery lifecycle which is after [alpha](#alpha) and before [live](#live).

Beta may be split into [private beta](#private-beta) and [public beta](#public-beta).

## C

## D

### Design history

Like a blog, it helps teams to talk about changes to services and how data, research, or other factors change a service. 

We have a [service where all DfE's design histories are published](https://design-histories.education.gov.uk).

### Discovery

A phase in the delivery lifecycle which is the first phase and before [alpha](#alpha).

## E

## F

## G

## H

## I

## J

## K

## L

### Live

A phase in the delivery lifecycle which is the final phase and after [beta](#beta).

## M

### MVP

MVP is an acronym for Minimum Viable Product. This is used to describe a service with meets the minimum requirements of a [user need](#user-need). 

It is often used to describe the first release or iteration of a service. 

### MVS

MVS is an acronym for Minimum Viable Service. Same as [MVP](#mvp)

## N

## O

## P

### Private beta

A phase in [beta](#beta) where testing of a service is carried out with a closed group of users.

This allows service teams to work with the users to better understand any problems and get targeted feedback. It also allows teams to understand service performance without being overwhelmed with users.

### Public beta

A phase in [beta](#beta) where testing of a service is unrestricted to users. 

## Q

## R

## S

### Service assessments

A formal process which happens in the [discovery](#discovery), [alpha](#alpha), and [beta](#beta) phases to ensure teams are working to, and delivering against, the [Service Standard](#service-standard). 

You can use the [Apply the Service Standard in DfE](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk) service for guidance in meeting the standard in DfE.

### Service Standard

The 14 point Service Standard helps teams to build good services and is measured through [service assessments](#service-assessments).

## T

## U

### User need

User needs are the needs that a user has of a service, and which that service must satisfy for the user to get the right outcome for them.
