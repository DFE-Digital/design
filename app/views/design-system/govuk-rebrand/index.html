        ## About the rebrand

          From 25 June 2025, a new brand and visual identity will be introduced to GOV.UK and products and services provided by DfE.

          The new brand identity is available to use in GOV.UK Frontend 5.10.0. You can [read the release notes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.10.0) for more information about the changes and how to implement them.

                    ### What is changing

          There are 4 main changes to the brand identity from 25 June, additional changes will be introduced over time. 

          The initial changes are:

   <ul>
<li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/" rel="nofollow">GOV.UK header</a></li>
<li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/" rel="nofollow">GOV.UK footer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/" rel="nofollow">Service navigation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/cookie-banner/" rel="nofollow">Cookie banner</a></li>
</ul>
       
       ### Where it will be used

        
          This new identity will be used across all GOV.UK website pages, GOV.UK Notify, GOV.UK Pay, GOV.UK Forms, the GOV.UK App and social media.

          All services being developed now, and going live after 25 June 2025, should use the new brand identity.

          ## DfE Header

          Any services using the existing [DfE Header (Legacy)](/design-system/components/header) will need to update to the new brand identity, following the [DfE Header (Rebrand) page](/design-system/govuk-rebrand/dfe-header-rebrand) instructions.

          The existing DfE Header (Legacy), will be decomissioned on 1 January 2026 and should not be used.


          ## What you need to do

          > You have until 31 December 2025 to complete the update for all DfE services which use either the GOV.UK header or DfE Header.
