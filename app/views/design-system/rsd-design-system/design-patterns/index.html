<p>In Regional Services Division (RSD), we use the GOV.UK Design System so that the look and function of the products is similar across the suite, and
    to GOV.UK. </p>
<p>However, each team has interpreted and applied the design system to their context. This means that the products may
    be meeting similar or the same needs, but the solutions look or function differently.</p>
<p>Over time we want our suite of products to become consistent, so that it&#39;s easier for users to learn and use
    multiple products. </p>
<p>By creating a library of design patterns and applying these to meet user needs, we will create this similarity and
    also:</p>
<ul>
    <li>it will be quicker to design and build our products</li>
    <li>we will spend less time solving problems which other teams have already solved</li>
    <li>it will make it easier to maintain the suite of products once they are managed by Service Support</li>
</ul>
<p>We have had some user feedback that it&#39;s easy to use a product because they are familiar with another product
    which works similarly. We have also had feedback that where one product does something but another product does not,
    it&#39;s confusing and they waste time trying to work out how to achieve their goal. </p>
<p>We will continue to gather insight from users to understand where inconsistency is causing them problems, and where
    consistency may help them. </p>
<h2>Rolling-out design patterns across RSD</h2>
<h3>When designing something new or improving an existing design</h3>
<p>We check the <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Lists/RSD%20crossprogramme%20user%20needs/AllItems.aspx?env=WebViewList">user needs database (opens on DfE intranet)</a> to see if a user need we have identified is
    documented for other products.</p>
<p>If it is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the need will link to any associated design patterns used in existing products</li>
    <li>we apply the pattern or re-use the design</li>
    <li>we update the user needs database to reflect the user need and pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is not, we:</p>
<ul>
    <li>document the new need in the user needs database</li>
    <li>create a new design</li>
    <li>capture our reasons for deviating from the design pattern in the user needs
        database</li>
</ul>
<h3>We have an existing design which we are not planning to iterate</h3>
<p>Over time we want to update existing designs to follow our design patterns as well. </p>
<p>If we do not have the opportunity to apply a design pattern to new work or an iteration, we prioritise 2 aspects
    of our products to update and follow a design pattern. </p>
<h2>Ceremonies</h2>
<p>We use our programme's interaction design community of practice (14:00 every Wednesday) to share designs at an early stage
    and discuss design patterns. RSD&#39;s Head of UCD joins these sessions to support teams to do this. </p>
<p>We use our UCD community meetings (14:00 Monday, monthly) to discuss iterations to existing patterns, and potential
    new patterns. </p>
<h2>Prioritisation</h2>
<p>We prioritise design patterns through our programme's &#39;front door&#39; prioritisation process. This means our Senior Leadership Team and PMs input into prioritisation. </p>
<p>Our cross-cutting UCD group suggest a shortlist of design patterns as candidates for prioritisation, based on weighted shortest job first (WSJF) and input from across the programme.</p>
