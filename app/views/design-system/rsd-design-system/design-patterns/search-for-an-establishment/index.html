        <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
        <p>Use this pattern to help users:
          <ul>
            <li>find information about an establishment, like an academy trust or a school</li>
            <li>store details about an establishment. For example, in a case management system</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>How it works </h2>

        <p>This pattern includes a:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>search page, with a search box for basic keyword searching</li>
          <li>search results page, showing the most important information about each establishment. Allow users to choose which option they want to see detailed information about.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Search page snippet?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Search results page snippet?</strong></p>

        <p>After these pages, there are 2 variations depending on the context.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Read information about an establishment.</li>
          <li>Select an establishment to store information about it.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Read information about an establishment</h3>

        <p>When users have selected an establishment from the search results page, take them to a separate page which has more information about the establishment.</p>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" style="margin: 0;">
          <img style="border: 1px solid #999999;" src="/assets/images/rsd-design-patterns/search-for-an-establishment-read-only-basic.png"
            alt="Search an establishment for read-only purpose (basic)" width="100%">
          <figcaption>Read information about an establishment - basic version</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h3>Select an establishment to store information about it</h3>

        <p>When users have selected an establishment from the search results page, take them to a separate page that shows detailed information about the establishment.</p>

        <p>Allow users to confirm if this is the establishment they were looking for. If it is, let them select it so they can store information about it somewhere.</p>

        <p>If it's not the establishment they are looking for, send them back to the search page.</p>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" style="margin: 0;">
          <img style="border: 1px solid #999999;" src="/assets/images/rsd-design-patterns/search-for-an-establishment-journey-basic.png"

          <figcaption>Select an establishment to store information about it - basic version</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h3>Autocomplete</h3>

        <p>You can use autocomplete as a progressive enhancement to the search page. This will present a list of results under the text input, as users type.</p>
          
        <h4>'Read information about an establishment' autocomplete</h4>
        
        <p>When users select a result from the dynamic list and then Continue, show detailed information about the establishment on a separate page.</p>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" style="margin: 0;">

        <h4>'Select an establishment' autocomplete</h4>

        <p>When users select a result from the dynamic list and then Continue, show detailed information about the establishment on a separate page.</p>

        <p>If users found the establishment they were looking for, let them carry on with their journey.</p>

        <p>If it's not the establishment they were looking for, send them back to the search page.</p>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" style="margin: 0;">
          <img style="border: 1px solid #999999;" src="/assets/images/rsd-design-patterns/search-for-an-establishment-journey-progressive-enhancement.png"

        <h2>Research on this pattern</h2>
        <p>We have not done research on this design pattern, but parts of the pattern are being used in <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/find-information-about-academies-trusts">Find information about academies and trusts</a> and <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/manage-free-school-projects">Manage free school projects</a> to meet this need from our <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Lists/RSD%20crossprogramme%20user%20needs/AllItems.aspx?env=WebViewList">user needs database (opens a DfE Microsoft List)</a>:</p>
        
        <p><strong>User need 96:</strong> When I need to find information about an establishment, I need flexibility in what I can search by, so that I can easily find the school/trust I am looking for.</p>
