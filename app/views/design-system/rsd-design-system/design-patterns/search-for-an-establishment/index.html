        <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
        <p>Use this pattern to help users:
          <ul>
            <li>find information about an establishment, like an academy trust or a school</li>
            <li>store details about an establishment. For example, in a case management system</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>How it works </h2>

        <p>This pattern has 2 variations, depending on the context.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Read information about an establishment.</li>
          <li>Select an establishment to store information about it.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Read information about an establishment</h3>

        <p>The variation has 3 pages:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Page with a search box, for basic keyword searching.</li>
          <li>Establishment results list, showing the most important information about each establishment. Allow users to choose which option they want to see detailed information about.</li>
          <li>Establishment details, showing detailed information about the selected establishment.</li>
        </ol>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" style="margin: 0;">

        <h4>Progressive enhancement</h4>

        <p>You can use the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete">autocomplete component on GitHub</a> as a progressive enhancement to the search box.</p>
        
        <p>This will reduce the number of pages in the journey to 2:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Page with a search box. Present a list of results under the text input, as users type. When users select a result from the dynamic search list and then Continue, take them to the next page.</li>
          <li>Establishment details, showing detailed information about the selected establishment.</li>
        </ol>

          <li>Establishment details, showing detailed information about the selected establishment. Allow users to confirm if this is the establishment they were looking for. If it is, let them select it so they can store information about it somewhere. If it's not, take them back to the search page.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Research on this pattern</h2>
        <p>We have not done research on this design pattern, but parts of the pattern are being used in <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/find-information-about-academies-trusts">Find information about academies and trusts</a> and <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/manage-free-school-projects">Manage free school projects</a> to meet this need from our <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Lists/RSD%20crossprogramme%20user%20needs/AllItems.aspx?env=WebViewList">user needs database (opens a DfE Microsoft List)</a>:</p>
        
        <p><strong>User need 96:</strong> When I need to find information about an establishment, I need flexibility in what I can search by, so that I can easily find the school/trust I am looking for.</p>
