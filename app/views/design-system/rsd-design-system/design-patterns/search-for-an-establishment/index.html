        <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
        <p>When users need to search for information about an establishment (e.g. an academy trust or a school), or provide details about the establishment.</p>

        <h2>How it works </h2>

        <p>There could be a few different scenarios:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>searching for an establishment as read-only information</li>
          <li>searching for an establishment as part of a longer journey</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>1. Searching for an establishment as read-only information</h3>

        <p>You may want to search for information of an establishment for read-only purpose without adding the information retrieved into another user journey.</p>

        <h4>Basic Design</h4>

        <p>For the basic version where JavaScript is disabled, the pages involved should be:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Provide a simple input box for keyword search.</li>
          <li>Provide a list of possible results, ideally in an overview format.</li>
          <li>Provide the detailed information of the result selected.</li>
        </ol>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" style="margin: 0;">
          <img style="border: 1px solid #999999;" src="/assets/images/rsd-design-patterns/search-for-an-establishment-read-only-basic.png"
            alt="Search an establishment for read-only purpose (basic)" width="100%">
          <figcaption>Search an establishment for read-only purpose (basic)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h4>Progressive enhancement</h4>

        <p>For the progressive enhancement where JavaScript is allowed, the pages involved should be:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Provide a input box with autocomplete enabled for keyword search. Show the list of possible results under the input box dynamically.</li>
          <li>Provide the detailed information of the result selected.</li>
        </ol>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" style="margin: 0;">
          <img style="border: 1px solid #999999;" src="/assets/images/rsd-design-patterns/search-for-an-establishment-read-only-progressive-enhancement.png"

          <figcaption>Search an establishment for read-only purpose (progressive enhancement)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>2. Searching for an establishment as part of a longer journey</h3>

        <p>You may want to search for information of an establishment and use it as part of a longer journey.</p>

        <h4>Basic Design</h4>

        <p>For the basic version where JavaScript is disabled, the pages involved should be:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Provide a simple input box for keyword search.</li>
          <li>Provide a list of possible results, ideally in an overview format, and allow users to choose the which option they want to see the detailed information in the next page.</li>
          <li>Provide the detailed information of the result selected. Ask users to confirm that this is the establishment they want, or bring them back to the search results page if the result is not what they want.</li>
        </ol>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" style="margin: 0;">
          <img style="border: 1px solid #999999;" src="/assets/images/rsd-design-patterns/search-for-an-establishment-journey-basic.png"
            alt="Searching for an establishment as part of a longer journey (basic)" width="100%">
          <figcaption>Searching for an establishment as part of a longer journey (basic)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h4>Progressive enhancement</h4>

        <p>For the progressive enhancement where JavaScript is allowed, the pages involved should be:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Provide a input box with autocomplete enabled for keyword search. Show the list of possible results under the input box dynamically.</li>
          <li>Provide the detailed information of the result selected. Ask users to confirm that this is the establishment they want, or bring them back to the keyword search page if the result is not what they want.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Research on this pattern</h2>
        <p>We have not done research on this design pattern, but the pattern is being used in <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/prepare-conversions-transfers">Prepare conversions and transfers</a> and <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/complete-conversions-transfers-and-changes">Complete conversions, transfers and changes</a> to meet this need from our <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Lists/RSD%20crossprogramme%20user%20needs/AllItems.aspx?env=WebViewList">user needs database (opens a DfE Microsoft List)</a>:</p>
        
        <p><strong>User need 22:</strong> when I have a question about project data in MAP Complete and Prepare, I need the name and email address of the DO or RCS caseworker responsible for the project, so I can get in touch with them to address my query.</p>
