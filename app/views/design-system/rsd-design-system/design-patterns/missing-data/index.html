    <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
    <p>Use this pattern to tell users that data they expected to see cannot be displayed. </p>

    <h2>When not to use this pattern</h2>

    <p>Do not use this pattern to help users add missing information in a <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list"></a>summary list. Instead, follow the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/#summary-cards:~:text=Showing%20missing%20information">show missing information in summary lists</a> guidance.</p> 

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>There are 3 variations of this pattern:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Data can be added in the service.</li>
      <li>Data needs adding outside of the service.</li>
      <li>Data can <strong>not</strong> be added.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Data can be added in the service</h3>

    <p>An example is data missing on a projects list page, that the user can add themselves.</p>

    <p>In this case, make it clear that the user can add this information.</p>

    <p>For example, an "Add this" link that takes the user to where they can add the information. Include hidden text so users know which piece of data the link relates to. </p>

    <h3>Data needs adding outside of the service</h3>

    <p>An example is missing data from <a href="https://get-data-schools.service.gov.uk/">GIAS (Get Information about Schools)</a> that would normally appear in <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/find-data-about-academies-trusts">FIAT (Find information about academies)</a>.</p>
    
    <p>A user may not be able to directly add the missing data in FIAT, but they may want to speak to a school and ask them to update GIAS.</p>
    
    <p>In this case, make it clear that the data comes from another place.</p>
    
    <p>For example, "Missing from GIAS (Get Information about Schools)".</p>
    
    <p>If the user has permissions to add data to the external service, use a call-to-action link explaining where the user can add the data.
    
    <p>For example, "<a href="https://get-data-schools.service.gov.uk/">Add this to GIAS (Get Information about Schools)</a>".</p>

    <h3>Data can not be added</h3>

<p>An example is where an Ofsted inspection did not take place for a school, but users are expecting to see Ofsted data in your service.</p>

<p>Consider using "Not available" because it makes it clear that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the data cannot be provided</li>
  <li>your service is working as expected</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid words that suggest the user can add this data themselves, like "Empty".</p>
    
    <h2>Research on this pattern</h2>
    <p>We have not done research on this design pattern, but we believe using it can help teams to meet this <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/manage-free-school-projects/risk-rating-iteration">Manage free school projects</a> to meet this need from our <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Lists/RSD%20crossprogramme%20user%20needs/AllItems.aspx?env=WebViewList">user needs database (opens a DfE Microsoft List)</a>:</p>
    
    <p><strong>User need 122:</strong> when I am using data from a system, I need to know why there are blank fields, so that I don't spend time going to places to understand why there is missing data.</p>
