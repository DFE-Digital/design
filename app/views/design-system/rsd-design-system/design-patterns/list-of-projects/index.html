        <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>

        <p>There are 2 variations you can use, depending on the context:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Read information about an establishment. Use this variation to help users find detailed information about an establishment, like an academy trust or a school.</li>
          <li>Select an establishment. Use this one to help users store details about an establishment. For example, in a project on a case management system.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Read information about an establishment</h2>

        <p>The variation has 3 pages:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Page with a search box, for basic keyword searching.</li>
          <li>Establishment results list, showing the most important information about each establishment. Allow users to choose which option they want to see detailed information about.</li>
          <li>Establishment details, showing detailed information about the selected establishment.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Page with a search box</h4>
        {{ sample.code('/design-system/rsd-design-system/design-patterns/search-for-an-establishment/example-search-box-page-basic.html', 'Page with a search box (basic)', 'search-box-page-basic-1',

        <h3>Progressive enhancement</h3>

        <p>You can use the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete">autocomplete component on GitHub</a> as a progressive enhancement to the search box.</p>
        
        <p>This will reduce the number of pages in the journey to 2:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Page with a search box. Present a list of results under the text input, as users type. When users select a result from the dynamic search list and then Continue, take them to the next page.</li>
          <li>Establishment details, showing detailed information about the selected establishment.</li>
        </ol>

          <li>Establishment details, showing detailed information about the selected establishment. Allow users to confirm if this is the establishment they were looking for.

        <h2>Reference numbers</h2>

        <p>There are many different unique references for establishments, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unique Reference Number (URN) â€“ from <a href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk">Get Information about Schools</a></li>
          <li>UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) - from <a href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk">UK Register of Learning Providers</a></li>
          <li>Group Identifier (Group ID) - also known as Trust Reference Number (TRN)</li>
          <li>Companies House number - from <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk">Find and update company information</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should research with your users to see which references they are familiar with.</p>
        <p>If they are familiar with one or more references, design for them on the search box page. This will save users' time and help avoid errors.</p>

        <h2>Error messages</h2>
        <p>Make sure errors follow the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/">error message</a> guidance. Show specific error messages for specific error states.</p>
        
        <h3>If the search box is empty</h3>
        <p>Say 'Enter a trust name or reference number'.</p>

        <h2>Research on this pattern</h2>
        <p>We have not done research on this design pattern, but parts of the pattern are being used in <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/find-information-about-academies-trusts">Find information about academies and trusts</a> and <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/manage-free-school-projects">Manage free school projects</a> to meet this need from our <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Lists/RSD%20crossprogramme%20user%20needs/AllItems.aspx?env=WebViewList">user needs database (opens a DfE Microsoft List)</a>:</p>
        
        <p><strong>User need 96:</strong> When I need to find information about an establishment, I need flexibility in what I can search by, so that I can easily find the school/trust I am looking for.</p>
