        <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>

        <p>Provide a view where your users can see a list of the summary of projects in your service.</p>
          
        <p>For a lot of internal facing case management services, it is very often that our service will need to provide a view for our users to see multiple projects at a glance. Therefore, seeing a list of projects is a common user need.</p>
        
        <h2>Content for each project</h2>

        <p>Very often, there will be many fields in each project. It is impossible to put all the fields into a project record on the project listing page. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct user researches to make sure the fields you picked are the most useful for your users. Here are some common fields that could be included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>project title</li>
          <li>project ID</li>
          <li>key dates</li>
          <li>project status</li>
          <li>a link to the individul project page (could be the project title)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project summary layout</h2>

        <p>Listing of projects should always be in a vertical format. But regarding the format of each project summary, there are 2 variations you can use, depending on the context:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>tabular design</li>
          <li>card design</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The choice of design depends on your services. Common factors to consider includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>whether it is important for the users to be able to compare projects</li>
          <li>whether it is important to see a lot of information in the summaries</li>
          <li>page width</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tabular design</h3>

        <p>A tabular design typically uses the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/table/">GOV.UK Table component</a> to show the header at the top, with a list of projects below it:</p>

        {{ sample.code('/design-system/rsd-design-system/design-patterns/list-of-projects/example-list-of-projects-tabular-design.html', 'List of projects (tabular design)', 'list-of-projects-tabular-design',
          codeSnippet.htmlCodeListofProjectsTabularDesign) }}

        <p>The tabular design will be more suitable if your users need to be able to compare the projects on this page, because the height of each project summary is relatively shorter.</p>

        <h3>Card design</h3>

        <p>A card design typically uses the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/table/">GOV.UK Table component</a> to stack up the projects, but the content inside could be more flexible. You can use your own way to layout the elements inside:</p>

        {{ sample.code('/design-system/rsd-design-system/design-patterns/list-of-projects/example-list-of-projects-card-design.html', 'List of projects (card design)', 'list-of-projects-card-design',
          codeSnippet.htmlCodeListofProjectsCardDesign) }}
        
        <p>The card design will be more suitable if your users need to be able read more content at the summary level, and the comparison of projects is not important because the height of each project summary is relatively taller.</p>

        <!--
        <h2>Multiple views</h2>

        <p>Provide a subset of the list of projects in a separated page if it is found useful to the users. For example, the user could be interested in seeing their own projects, or a manager would like to see a list of projects for people they manage. Provide a separate view alongside the full set of projects could be useful.</p>

        {{ sample.code('/design-system/rsd-design-system/design-patterns/list-of-projects/example-list-of-projects-tabular-design-all-projects.html', 'List of projects (tabular design) - all projects', 'list-of-projects-tabular-design-all-projects',
          codeSnippet.htmlCodeListofProjectsTabularDesignAllProjects) }}
        -->

        <h2>Research on this pattern</h2>
        <p>We have not done research on this design pattern, but parts of the pattern are being used in <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/find-information-about-academies-trusts">Find information about academies and trusts</a> and <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/manage-free-school-projects">Manage free school projects</a> to meet this need from our <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceDeliveryDirectorate/Lists/RSD%20crossprogramme%20user%20needs/AllItems.aspx?env=WebViewList">user needs database (opens a DfE Microsoft List)</a>:</p>
        
        <p><strong>User need 8:</strong> When managing my team's workload, I need to see the projects each individual is working on alongside new incoming projects, so that I can understand capacity in my team and allocate project accordingly.</p>
        <p><strong>User need 30:</strong> When looking at the projects happing in my region, I need to know the status and progress being made on different projects so that I see the workload of different team members.</p>
        <p><strong>User need 90:</strong> When accessing Prepare and looking for my projects, I need an easy way to view all projects I'm working on in one view, so I can monitor and manage my own workload.</p>
