<p>You should use the Regional Services Division design system to help you design and create applications to support RSD.<a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/team/regional-services-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regional Service Division design histories website</a>. They cannot be used on any other websites or products.</p>
<p>This will help ensure we design a consistent service for users accessing the RSD Services.</p>
<h2>GOV.UK and DfE Design System</h2>
<p>Regional Services Division applications and websites are hosted on gov.uk domains and are managed by a team within the Department for Education.</p>
<p>This means that for anything that does not exist in the Regional Services Division design system, you can use the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Design System</a> and the main <a href="/design-system/">DfE Design Manual</a>.</p>
