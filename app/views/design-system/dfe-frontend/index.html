      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using DfE Frontend to extend GOV Frontend</h2>

      <p>You cannot use DfE Frontend on it's own, it is not a replacement for <a
          href="https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Frontend</a>. </p>

      <p>Follow the <a href="/design-system/getting-started">getting started</a> guidance for installing DfE Frontend
      </p>

      <p>Once installed, you can then make use of <a href="/design-system/styles">styles</a>, <a
          href="/design-system/components">components</a>, and <a href="/design-system/patterns">patterns</a> in the
        design system.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use DfE Frontend</h2>

      <p>Use DfE Frontend when your product or service is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>for internal staff</li>
        <li>provided on the education.gov.uk domain</li>
        <li>provided on service.gov.uk and you want to use components not in the GOV.UK Design System.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why you would use DfE Frontend</h2>

      <p>There are instances where a component or pattern doesn't exist in the GOV.UK Design System, or, there is a
        specific use-case scenario which means something specific to DfE is needed.</p>

      <p>This is where DfE Frontend comes in. You can use components and patterns from DfE Frontend in your products and
        services to meet these needs consistently.</p>
      <p>If you build something custom, you should <a href="#contributions">contribute it back into the design
          system</a> for others to use. You can do this by making it available in DfE Frontend.</p>
      <p>Working in the open, contributing to common patterns and components, is a requirement of <a
          href="https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard/13-use-common-standards-components-patterns">point
          13 of the Government Service Standard</a>.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="contributions">Contributions</h2>

      <p>DfE Frontend is managed by the <a href="/design-ops">DesignOps team</a> and accepts contributions from the
        design community.</p>
      <p>If you are building services and you create custom components or patterns which are not in the GOV.UK Design
        System, you must contribute these to the DfE Design System.</p>

      <p>You should also contribute back to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/43/views/1"
          target="_blank">GOV.UK Design System backlog</a>.</p>

      <p>You can submit contributions in the following ways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-frontend/issues" target="_blank">create an issue</a> in the
          repository</li>
        <li>Make the change as a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-frontend"
            target="_blank">repository</a></li>
        <li><a href="mailto:design.ops@education.gov.uk?subject=DfE Frontend suggestion">email DesignOps</a> with your
          suggestion</li>
      </ul>
