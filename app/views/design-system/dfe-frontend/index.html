          ## When to use DfE Frontend

          Use DfE Frontend when designing and developing digital services for DfE. 
          
          It ensures:

          * a consistent user experience across DfE services
          * alignment with the [Digital Product Branding](https://standards.education.gov.uk/standard/digital-product-branding) standard
          * faster development by reusing ready-made components and styles

          DfE Frontend should be used by designers and developers working on public-facing services, internal applications, and digital tools that are part of the departmentâ€™s digital ecosystem.

          ## Get started

          To start using DfE Frontend, follow the [install DfE Frontend](/design-system/dfe-frontend/install) instructions.

          ## Contribute to DfE Frontend

          Where you identify a pattern or component in a product that could be reused, consider contributing it to DfE Frontend. 

          Doing this will also ensure you are working to meet Service Standard point 13, [Use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard/13-use-common-standards-components-patterns).

          To contribute to DfE Frontend, follow the [contribute to DfE Frontend](/design-system/dfe-frontend/contribute) instructions.
