      ## Why use the prototype kit

      The GOV.UK prototype kit is the easiest way to create realistic examples of services to test with users.

      The current version of the kit is version 13, and is recommended you use this to build prototypes with.

      You can <a href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/create-new-prototype" class="govuk-link"
        rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">follow instructions to get the kit running on your device</a> as well
      as
      tutorials and support from the GDS team who built the kit.

      This helps you de-risk your service, without commiting to building the real thing in code, or needing a developer
      to
      build something for you.

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">Prototypes should be throwaway code, not treated like production code. You should
        only be
        building things in the kit to test assumptions or problems.</div>

      ## Installing the kit

      Whether you use a Mac or Windows device, you can run the kit locally on your device. You'll need to install some
      software to do this.

      ### Macbook users

      If you're using a DfE-issued Macbook, you can install all the required software yourself.

      ### Windows device users

      If you're a DfE-issued Windows device users, you'll need to submit a request to <a
        href="https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=2f8ef25b1b76f450199d6397b04bcbc4"
        target="_blank" class="govuk-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Service Now - GDS Prototyping</a>

      When you install the kit, create a folder on the C:\ drive called "prototypes" and extract the kit to a folder
      within
      your prototypes folder.

      eg: `c:\prototypes\my-first-prototype\`

      Do not run them from your Documents or Desktop or any folder that syncs with OneDrive.

      ## Support with the kit.

      The kit is used across Government, is built by, managed and supported by a team in GDS.

      ## Branding your prototype

      You must use the correct branding for where a service is intended to be provided.

      ### Services intended for GOV.UK or service.gov.uk

      You can use the kit directly as-is on install for a service that looks like GOV.UK

      ### Services intended for education.gov.uk

      You should follow the <a href="/design-system/dfe-frontend" class="govuk-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">DfE
        Frontend
        guidance</a> so that your prototype is using the correct DfE branding and styles.

      If you are unsure, <a href="/design-ops" class="govuk-link">contact DesignOps</a>.
