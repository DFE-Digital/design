<p>At the National Careers Service, we take a user-centred, iterative, inclusive and open approach to design. This approach is in addition to following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Government Design Principles</a>.</p>
<h2>User-centred</h2>
<p>We put users at the centre of our decisions to make sure the National Careers Service website and its components work for the people who need it. </p>
<h2>Iterative</h2>
<p>We should always test and refine our designs as we learn more about our users and the way they use the website.</p>
<h2>Inclusive</h2>
<p>The National Careers Service website is for everyone. We want to make sure people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs can use the design of our website.</p>
<h2>Open</h2>
<p>We want to work in the open at the National Careers Service.</p>
<p>We aim to share our learning and our work and be transparent in our design decisions. This means we hold ourselves accountable and have confidence in our solutions.</p>
