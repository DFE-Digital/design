    <li>in pink and never changed to a different colour</li>
    <li>with a minimum height of 10mm or 35px</li>
    <li>with a maximum height of 25mm</li>
    <li>in an area clear of other graphics with a width of this exclusion zone is equal to the height of the capital N in the logo</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use with other logos</h2>
