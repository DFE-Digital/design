<p>You should use the National Careers Service design system to help you design and create pages on the <a href="https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Careers Service website</a>. They cannot be used on any other websites or products.</p>
<p>This will help ensure we design a consistent service for users accessing the National Careers Service.</p>
<h2>GOV.UK and DfE Design System</h2>
<p>The National Careers Service website is hosted on a service.gov.uk domain and is managed by a team within the Department for Education.</p>
<p>This means that for anything that does not exist in the National Careers Service design system, you can use the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Design System</a> and the main <a href="/design-system/">DfE Design Manual</a>.</p>
