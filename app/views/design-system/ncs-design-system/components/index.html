<p>The components in this section of the design system have been created by designers and developers at the National Careers Service.</p>
<h2>How to use the components</h2>
<p>Each individual component includes a coded example so you can see what the component looks like. You can copy the HTML code directly from the example to use in your designs.</p>
<p>If you're using the <a href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a> or have included <a href="https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Frontend</a> in your build, the coded examples will appear the same as in the National Careers Service design system.</p>
