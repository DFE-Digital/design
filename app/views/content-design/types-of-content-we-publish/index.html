  <p>If you’re unsure where your service or content should sit, use <a href="https://should-your-product-be-on-gov.herokuapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"  target="_blank">Check if your product should be on GOV.UK (opens in a new tab) </a>.</p>

  <p>We produce written content, video, images and graphics to support our users to access and deliver services.</p>

  <p>Each of our channels has the capability of housing these content types. User needs should direct the creation of content, what is created, and at which point it should be delivered to support the users as they progress through their user journey.</p>

  <p>We typically use external providers to procure videos, graphics, images and marketing. Depending on the level of requirement we can accommodate some requests within teams. </p>
